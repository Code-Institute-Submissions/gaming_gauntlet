# **GAMING GAUNTLET**

Gaming gauntlet is a project designed around my love of gaming and challenge. As I felt my JavaScript knowledge is not quite advanced enough to create a game as complex and challenging as I would like to, the compromise I came to in that case is multiple simpler and easier games played consecutively. With the difficulty and score multiplier  changing in each game dependant on your performance in the previous one. 

The aim is to make 5 easily accessible and understandable games which will be played in a "gauntlet" style with no breaks in between. The order is up to the player with each consecutive win making the subsequent game harder while offering more points towards your final score. Hopefully creating the complexity and replay-ability I am aiming for without having that deeper coding knowledge I am just shy of at the moment

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

![Websites colour palette](documentation/gaming_gauntlet_palatte.png)

For this project the selected colours are used separately, each one being the primary colour for a single game with black, white and shades of gray used for everything else.

The limited colour palette for each single game is to try and reference the style of 4 and 8 bit games. This idea carries over to my color choice also as I tried to pick strong vivid colours that also reminded me of the 80s and 80s media.

#### Typography

For typography I decided to go for a singular font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) called Silkscreen. This was chosen for its retro feel and it gels well with the overall theme of playing old school games on a CRT Television.
