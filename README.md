# **GAMING GAUNTLET**

Gaming gauntlet is a project designed around my love of gaming and challenge. As I felt my JavaScript knowledge is not quite advanced enough to create a game as complex and challenging as I would like to, the compromise I came to in that case is multiple simpler and easier games played consecutively. With the difficulty and score multiplier  changing in each game dependant on your performance in the previous one. 

The aim is to make 5 easily accessible and understandable games which will be played in a "gauntlet" style with no breaks in between. The order is up to the player with each consecutive win making the subsequent game harder while offering more points towards your final score. Hopefully creating the complexity and replay-ability I am aiming for without having that deeper coding knowledge I am just shy of at the moment
